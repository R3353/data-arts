**Projects from my Digital Media - Data Arts class.**

This course explored the intersection of data, creativity, and ethics through hands-on digital artmaking. Instead of traditional writing, we used methods like animation, glitch art, video, and code to interrogate the role of data in our everyday lives.

We asked questions like:
- Can code be art?
- When is data oppressive or liberating?
- How can visual media communicate data's complexity, power, and subjectivity?

My projects ranged from raw data visualizations to experimental digital artworks that challenged conventional ideas of objectivity, surveillance, privacy, and aesthetics.

***This repo documents my creative responses and technical experiments from the course.***

# Studio assignments:
## Studio 2: MoMA exploratory data
- found in `studio2_MoMA_data.png`
- Question: How have the mediums of art submitted to MoMA changed over time?
- Represented by a stacked bar chart; coded on *jupyterhub*

## Studio 5: Me in Layers
- found in `studio5_me_in_layers.png`
- Utilized *Adobe Photoshop* to represent myself in 3 layers.

# Projects:
## Project 6: Patterns of Identity - What are the hidden patterns that exist in your life? 
- My topic: Fast Fashion & Social Media

- Visual representing my research found in `Proj6_icon.png`.
- Created using *Google Slides* and *Adobe InDesign*

## Project 11: Piece of the Future
- Objective: create a visually engaging 3D art piece portraying my idea of the future.
- Explored *Blender* to portray a future of humans being enhanced by technology. I added features like bright colors, texture, and ideological exaggeration for visual engagement.

## Project 12: Hard to say
- Objective: create an image expressing what is hard to say for me.
- image and audio to demo of "how are you? hard to say.": https://youtu.be/kuosW0E8qbY?si=SjBnjfKzPus6p_s3
- An image wasn't speaking to me... so I created a song instead.
- Produced on *Ableton*; Illustrated on whiteboard with whiteboard marker.

## Project 13: Past project revisited - Hard to say
- Objective: revisit a past project in the course.
- image and audio to final version of "how are you? hard to say.": https://youtu.be/4Q6AgaxL170?si=OhbMmGF0w6g43Sa3
- I revisited my Project 12 by exploring *DALL-E* technology, which was new at the time, to create an illustration that portrayed how the song I created feels to me.
- Translated feelings to music. Music to words. Words to prompts. Prompts to an image.
